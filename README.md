Basic game in development written in Lua using Love2D

I'm trying to learn how to use Love2D, and game design in general.
Also, understanding git won't hurt.

Features planned:
-----------------
#### Important:
* Optimized grid system
* Map generator
* Improved controls and feel to the game

#### Extras:
* Better graphics (But still having the option for simple graphics)
* Title screen
* Loot (Coins, Powerups)

#### Down the road:
* Map Editor
* Baddies
* Hopefully much more...
