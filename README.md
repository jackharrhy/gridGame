gridGame
========

Basic game in development written in Lua using Love2D

I'm trying to learn how to use Love2D, and game design in general.
Also, understanding git won't hurt.

Running
-------

This game was designed on the latest love2d version (0.9.1).

#### Installing love on Linux

##### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get install love
```

##### Archlinux
```sh
sudo pacman -S love

```

##### Fedora
```sh
yum install love
```

#### Installing love on Windows
Just head to http://love2d.org and download the .exe

#### Running on Linux

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jackharrhy/gridGame.git
cd gridGame/
love src/
```

Features planned:
-----------------
#### Important:
* Optimized grid system
* Map generator
* Improved controls and feel to the game

#### Extras:
* Better graphics (But still having the option for simple graphics)
* Title screen
* Loot (Coins, Powerups)

#### Down the road:
* Map Editor
* Baddies
* Hopefully much more...
